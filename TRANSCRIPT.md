- 2025-09-02 14:16 PDT — Fixed Prisma schema hardcoded output path causing ENOENT by removing absolute `output` from `prisma/schema.prisma` (use default node_modules path).
- 2025-09-02 14:18 PDT — Ran `pnpm prisma generate` successfully. Quick smoke test: started Next dev on port 3010 via `pnpm exec next dev -p 3010` and confirmed readiness, then stopped.
- 2025-09-02 14:22 PDT — Added `anoint_array/app/docker-compose.yml` for local Postgres (port 5433). Suggested `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://anoint:anoint@localhost:5433/anoint?schema=public` for local development if remote DB is unreachable.
- 2025-09-02 14:38 PDT — Updated `.env` and `.env.local` `DATABASE_URL` to local Docker Postgres; started container with `docker compose up -d` (env isolation via `--env-file`).

  - Admin UI: Added Variants section to add/edit modals with style, price, quantity rows; payload includes `variants`.
- 2025-09-02 15:02 PDT — Fixed product creation 500s: sanitized numeric parsing for price/weight/inventory and variant fields; removed invalid `select.variants: false` in GET; conditionally added variants to select (admin only).
- 2025-09-02 15:08 PDT — Set dev server port to 3002 by updating `anoint_array/app/package.json` script ("dev": "next dev -p 3002"). Confirmed NEXTAUTH_URL in `.env.local` is `http://localhost:3002`.

  - Support agent config API: `app/app/api/admin/support/config/route.ts` persisting to `data/support-config.json`.

- 2025-09-02 16:05 PDT — Wired storefront Payments to cart UI and runtime keys.
  - PaymentModal now fetches `/api/admin/storefront/payments` on open and shows only enabled methods; Stripe publishable key (test/live) is passed to the component dynamically.
  - `stripe-payment.tsx` now accepts a `publishableKey` prop and loads Stripe at runtime.
  - Server: Stripe/PayPal/NOWPayments creation endpoints read `data/storefront-payments.json` to pick test/live credentials (Stripe secret, PayPal base and creds, NowPayments key).
  - Masked secrets in GET `/api/admin/storefront/payments` response.

  - Admin Settings “Emails” tab to edit templates.
  - Cart: country selector with U.S.-only tariff notice during payment step.
- 2025-09-04 12:32 PDT — Order Management precheck + create order fixes.

  - Orders API: `POST /api/admin/orders` now persists OrderItems; uses transaction and accepts customs snapshot fields.
  - Create Order API: `POST /api/admin/orders/create` now creates real DB orders + items and optionally updates tracking on label creation.
  - Admin UI: `app/app/admin/orders/page.tsx` gained "Run Precheck" panel card and a "Quick Sample (CA)" button that creates a paid manual order using the first product; also hooks into precheck.
  - Goal: ensure the ability to seed/create orders and quickly validate wiring end‑to‑end.
- 2025-09-04 13:05 PDT — Precheck diagnostics expanded + DB port aligned.
  - Precheck DB tile now lists target host/port/db/user, alternate‑port probes with a recommended URL, and local service hints (no Docker).
