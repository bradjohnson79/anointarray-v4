# ANOINT Array — Energetics & Practice Guide

Author: Brad Johnson (Creator of ANOINT Array)

This guide gives the AI Support Agent and customers a practical reference for using ANOINT Array products with breath‑based energetic practices. It outlines intent, safety, and step‑by‑step methods for imbuing items with personal energy.

## About the Creator & Philosophy

- Brad Johnson has spent ~17 years developing energetic science and physical tools aimed at rejuvenation of the physical and subtle/energy bodies.
- ANOINT Array products are metaphysical/energetic tools, not medical devices. They are designed to help harmonize bio‑energetic fields in people, animals, plants, and environments.
- All benefits are experimental and subjective; results vary with consistency, sensitivity, and intent.

> Important: ANOINT Array does not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. Nothing herein is medical advice. For medical concerns, consult a qualified professional.

## Core Concepts (Quick Reference)

- Prana / Qi: Vital life‑force energy that circulates in and around the body.
- Breath as Carrier: Breath + attention + intent moves and concentrates energy.
- Imbuing Objects: You can “assign” a personal energetic signature to an object by deliberate breathwork and focused intent.
- Scalar / Transcendental Frequencies (in products): Encoded patterns intended to harmonize fields; they do not replace healthcare.

## Foundational Practice: Ujjayi (“Victorious / Ocean Breath”)

Use this when first receiving an item, and periodically to refresh the link.

1) Preparation
- Hold the selected ANOINT item in hand or place your palm on it.
- Adopt a relaxed, upright posture. Soften the jaw and chest, lengthen the spine.
- Set an intention (e.g., “Harmony and rejuvenation for my whole being”).

2) Ujjayi Mechanics
- Slightly constrict the throat/glottis so breath sounds gently like an ocean wave.
- Inhale slowly through the nose; feel a cool stream at the back of the throat.
- Exhale slowly through the nose with the same throat shape.

3) Three Imbuing Rounds
- Round 1: Inhale from the pelvic floor (perineum) up to the crown, sensing a gentle inner ascent of energy. Exhale into the item, imagining your breath‑borne energy saturating it.
- Round 2: Repeat; allow the chest and heart area to soften as you exhale into the item.
- Round 3: Repeat; sense the object “taking a signature print” of your prana.

4) Seal & Rest
- Place both hands over the item for 10–20 seconds. Breathe normally; feel warmth and resonance.
- Conclude with gratitude. Hydrate and remain relaxed for a few minutes.

Tips
- Duration: 3–5 minutes is enough for daily use; longer sessions are optional.
- Rhythm: Keep breath smooth, quiet, and unforced. No breath retention needed for basics.

## Alternate Practices (Use With Care)

These can be offered to users who request variations or have experience with breathwork. Always add the safety note: “Stop if you feel dizzy, anxious, or unwell.”

1) Box Breathing (Calming / Focus)
- Inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Repeat 6–10 cycles while touching the item.
- Good for grounding before sleep or integration after strong sessions.

2) Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril / Balancing)
- Gently close right nostril → inhale left; close left → exhale right.
- Then inhale right; close right → exhale left. That’s 1 round. Do 5–9 rounds.
- Promotes left/right channel balance while imbuing the item.

3) Microcosmic Orbit (Advanced)
- On inhale, trace attention up the spine (perineum → crown). On exhale, down the front midline (tongue lightly on palate), returning to the navel/perineum. Touch the item; let some exhaled attention flow into it.
- Keep breath gentle. 6–12 cycles.

4) Kapalabhati (Skull‑Shining / Cleansing) — Caution
- Short, sharp exhales through nose; passive inhales. 30–60 pumps max, then rest.
- Not for pregnancy, high blood pressure, or those prone to dizziness.

Safety & Contraindications
- Stop if discomfort, light‑headedness, or anxiety arises. Sit or lie down and breathe normally.
- Avoid forceful methods if pregnant, post‑surgery, or with heart/respiratory conditions.
- Breathwork is voluntary; users can choose the gentlest approach.

## Using ANOINT Items With People, Animals, Plants, Spaces

- People: Imbue personally (as above). You can also place an item in a meditation space during relaxed breathing or restorative yoga.
- Animals: Keep sessions gentle; observe the animal’s comfort. Shorter exposures are best.
- Plants: Place items near soil or pots; brief Ujjayi breaths to set intention (growth, vitality).
- Spaces: Place the item at a room center or a calm corner; use Ujjayi to “set” a harmony intention for the environment.

## Frequently Asked Guidance

- “How often should I imbue?” — Initial 3 rounds, then once daily for 1–3 minutes, or whenever you feel called.
- “What if I can’t feel energy?” — That’s normal. Consistency matters more than sensation.
- “Can I wash or expose items to sun?” — Follow the product’s material care guidelines. Energetic imprint is not typically affected by gentle cleaning.
- “Can I share my item?” — Personal imprinting is individual. If shared, consider re‑imbuing for each person.
