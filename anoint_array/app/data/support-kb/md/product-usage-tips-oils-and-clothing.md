## Oils (Essence / Anointing Oils)

Intent: Lightly support relaxation, clarity, and energetic coherence when combined with breathwork and intention.

General Tips
- Patch test first: place a small drop on inner wrist; wait 24 hours to check for sensitivity.
- External use only. Keep away from eyes. Keep out of reach of children and pets.
- Store in a cool, dark place with cap tightly closed.

How to Use
1) Palm Activation: place 1–2 drops in the palm; rub hands to warm; bring hands near face.
2) Breath + Intent: 3 relaxed Ujjayi breaths while holding a simple intent (e.g., “calm, clarity, balance”).
3) Light Application: temples (avoid eyes), behind ears, wrists, heart center, or soles of feet.
4) Posture: sit quietly for 2–5 minutes to integrate.

Common Use Cases (non‑medical)
- “Ground & Settle”: wrist + heart center; slow nasal breathing for 2–3 minutes.
- “Focus & Tasking”: behind ears; gentle box breathing for 1–2 minutes before work.
- “Evening Wind‑Down”: soles of feet; 3 Ujjayi cycles; dim the lights and hydrate.

Cautions
- Discontinue use if irritation occurs.
- Do not ingest; avoid use during pregnancy unless authorized by a professional.

## Clothing (Energetic Apparel)

Intent: Infuse everyday wear with an energetic reminder of harmony and presence. Clothing can be lightly imbued with breathwork.

How to Use
1) Before wearing, place the garment in your lap or hold it at the heart center.
2) Do 3 relaxed Ujjayi breaths, exhaling attention into the garment (imbuing step).
3) Wear as normal. Re‑imbue weekly or whenever desired.

Care
- Follow garment care label.
- Energetic imprinting is refreshed through breathwork rather than laundering.

Suggestions by Theme (non‑medical)
- “Calm Days”: choose softer colors/patterns, pair with 1–2 drops of calming oil at wrists.
- “Vitality Days”: pair with brighter patterns; try 3 microcosmic orbit breaths before leaving home.

## Choosing Between Decks (Healing Code Cards)

If a customer is unsure which deck to consider, the AI Support Agent can gently suggest:
- Body Deck: physical body support themes (rejuvenation, grounding, relaxation for the body). PNGs can help the agent show/recognize patterns when needed.
- Mind Deck: mental clarity, focus, calm thinking, study/creative sessions.
- Energy Deck: overall vitality, coherence, and “whole‑system” harmony cues.

How to Use a Card
1) Hold or place a card near the area of focus (or simply at the heart or navel).
2) Perform 3 Ujjayi breaths; on each exhale, imagine your energy imprinting the card.
3) Sit or lie quietly for 2–5 minutes (optional longer session).

Notes
- Cards are complementary, not medical devices. Sensations vary by person.
- Frequency of use: 1–2 short sessions per day or as intuitively guided.

## Safety & Disclaimers
